    solution:
      "The solution to this project is pretty simple. I wrote all of the HTML on the site. We also had to learn how to optimize and add photos. To go above and beyond I added extra pages that weren't required for the project. I also dabbled in changing some of the CSS just for practice.",

      "This project was pretty straight forward. First, you want to use CSS to make sure that the page is mobile friendly through media queries. From there it's just a matter of writing the CSS to match the mockup. This included font changes, spacing,  and some color choices. To go above and beyond I added a hover effect to the links then added the Skills section. I used CSS to build out the blocks that list out my skills.",

    solution:
      "Diving into Project Three was more difficult. I can be really daunting to look at a picture and try to code it into reality. Here I started learning the process of breaking projects down into chunks so that you have a place to start and tasks to complete. From there I wrote the HTML and started working on CSS. I was able to start learning Flexbox to get the spacing of the form to be right and responsive. To go above and beyond I added a section to the Newsletter portion and made some design changes.",

    solution:
      "First thing I did was set up the Scout App so that my SASS could have live compiling. Then it was a matter of organizing the files to take advantage of SASS and the reusable compenents. After that it was just about styling things to match the picture. To go above and beyond I used the SASS features of mix-ins and inline psuedo classes or states.",
