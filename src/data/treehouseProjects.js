      "This is the very fist project for Team Treehouse's Front End Web Development Techdegree. They start out by teaching you simple HTML. They provide some basic css and then task you with writing all of the html.",
    solution:
      "The solution to this project is pretty simple. I wrote all of the HTML on the site. We also had to learn how to optimize and add photos. To go above and beyond I added extra pages that weren't required for the project. I also dabbled in changing some of the CSS just for practice.",

      "Project two is all about getting into CSS. The Techdegree program supplies raw HTML as well as mockup image and then the student must use CSS to make the HTML look like the mockup.",
    solution:
      "This project was pretty straight forward. First, you want to use CSS to make sure that the page is mobile friendly through media queries. From there it's just a matter of writing the CSS to match the mockup. This included font changes, spacing,  and some color choices. To go above and beyond I added a hover effect to the links then added the Skills section. I used CSS to build out the blocks that list out my skills.",

    solution:
      "Diving into Project Three was more difficult. I can be really daunting to look at a picture and try to code it into reality. Here I started learning the process of breaking projects down into chunks so that you have a place to start and tasks to complete. From there I wrote the HTML and started working on CSS. I was able to start learning Flexbox to get the spacing of the form to be right and responsive. To go above and beyond I added a section to the Newsletter portion and made some design changes.",

      "Project Four is an introduction into style guides and reusable components. The student was asked to learn how to use SASS and compile it into proper CSS. The project is a mocked style guide. The Techdegree provided the html and an image for you to recreate.",
    solution:
      "First thing I did was set up the Scout App so that my SASS could have live compiling. Then it was a matter of organizing the files to take advantage of SASS and the reusable compenents. After that it was just about styling things to match the picture. To go above and beyond I used the SASS features of mix-ins and inline psuedo classes or states.",

      "Project five was the big dive into javascript. We had to learn all about javascript and alongside it jquery. Tasked with making a mockup searchable photo gallery, we were given a single png and had to write the HTML, CSS, and javascript to bring that image to life.",
    solution:
      "We were given a set of photos and thumbnail photos. Start I wrote the HTML and CSS to build the gallery to match the mock up given. Then I used very simple Javascript and jquery to create a lightbox for when the user clicks on the photo. To go above and beyond I used Javascript to create a search function which allowed the user to search for aspects in the photos and filter the results.",

    solution:
      "The first steps were using javascript to get the letters to respond to user input. From there it was all about keeping track of misses and correct guesses until the user had guessed all the letters. Then a screen showing win or lose had to show. To go above and beyond I set the game up to reset so that the user could play over again whether they win or lose.",

On top of that we also started learning about storing and retrieving data in the local host of the browser. For this project we were tasked with building a mock dashboard app. We were only given a single mockup image and a list of functionality. Then we had to build the functioning dashboard. It had to include javascript charts, toggle buttons, a notification window, and more.",
    solution:
      "This was by far the hardest project. I started by getting the HTML and CSS to match the mockup for the most part. I utilized the CSS grid function to build out the side bar of the app and make everything responsive. From there it was all about building the Javascript to add functionality to the dashboard. I used a jquery plugin to generate the charts and then used vanilla javascript to create the toggle switches, alert bar, and notification window. To go above in beyond I made the 'settings' portion interactable and allowed the user to store and clear their data from browser cache. ",

    solution:
      "This one was straightforward. I built the CSS and HTML to match the provided mockup. Then I used Javascript to build the popup modal when you clicked an employee, which provided more of the data. All the data was pulled from the API and parsed through Javascript. To go above and beyond I spent time giving the website and interesting dark mode theme and made the popup modals have arrows so that you could navigate through the employees.",
