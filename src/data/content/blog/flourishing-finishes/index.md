### Goal: 

With Flourishing Finishes I was asked by a local business owner to update her wordpress site to make it more engaging and modern. She needed help from start to finish. This included building the site, designing it, and writing all the content that was on it. I was excited to help her capture how important community and family were too her. 

### Solution:

The approach to this was to break down working through her project into 4 phases. First we'd have conversation so that I could understand her brand. Then I'd work up designs and content. After that I'd build the site. Finally I'd clean up the back end and deploy the site.

1. Branding - To start out we had lots of conversation. This gave me an opportunity to hear her story and discover what was important to her and her business. This also allowed me to guide her in clarifying her brand and message.
2. Design - In our branding conversations I realized that the client had a bright personality. I was also able to get a feel for the products that she made through Stampin' Up. I decided to take a simple, floral approach that focused on her bright colors with plent of white space. This would showcase the content which was a strong call to use crafting to find your community. 
3. Building - Her current site was on Wordpress and she wanted to stay there. So I utilized the Divi builder to build a modern website that was fast and simple. I employed custom Javascript and CSS where necessary. 
4. Backend - I installed Wordfence, Updraftplus, Yoast, and other plugins to make sure her site was secure, optimized, and backed up.
